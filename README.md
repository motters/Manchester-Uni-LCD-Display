This was a quick knock up ardunio sketch to controll the displayed voltages on the lcd display

Collect the 12 bit A/D data
Convert the 12 bit A/D data into voltages
Run the voltages through a moving avergae to smooth the results
Display voltage on the LCD

There are many setting at the top of the sketch and setup procedure. 
For Example
  * Update LCD display every X mill-seconds
  * Set voltages
  * Set filter value for each voltage
  * Set voltage displayed string
  * Positive and negitive points for each voltage
  * Fine tuning per voltage 
  * ETC
